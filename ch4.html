#The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. 

<!--Though Metasploit is now owned by the security company Rapid7, an open source edition is still available, with development largely driven by the security community.

Metasploit’s modular and flexible architecture helps developers efficiently create working exploits as new vulnerabilities are discovered

Metasploit now includes more than 1677 exploits organized over 25 platforms, including Android, PHP, Python, Java, Cisco, and more. The framework also carries nearly 500 payloads, -->
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Command shell payloads that enable users to run scripts or random commands against a host
#Dynamic payloads that allow testers to generate unique payloads to evade antivirus software
#Meterpreter payloads that allow users to commandeer device monitors using VMC and to take over sessions or upload and download files
#Static payloads that enable port forwarding and communications between networks

#Exploits: Tools used to take advantages of system weaknesses 
Payloads: sets of malicious code.
